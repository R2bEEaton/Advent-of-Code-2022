# Ryan Eaton's Advent of Code 2022
A repository to store my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Solutions will be slightly refactored for readability before submission. In other words...

```diff
+ Refactor to remove unused code
- No logic changes allowed
- No fixing the stupid or unnecessary checks I wrote
```

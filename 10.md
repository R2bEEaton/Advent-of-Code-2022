## Part 1

That was really fast! I finished 164th worldwide for Part 1. I made registers a dictionary to future-proof the code. Turned out it wasn't needed. I wonder if this will be used in any future problems like IntCode was.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import data_in, submit

ans = 0
din = data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
cycles = 0

regs = {"X": 1}


def cycle():
    global regs, cycles, ans
    cycles += 1
    if cycles in [x*40+20 for x in range(6)]:
        ans += regs["X"] * cycles


for line in din:
    if line.startswith("noop"):
        cycle()
    else:
        instr = line.split(" ")[0]
        num = int(line.split(" ")[1])

        if instr == "addx":
            cycle()
            cycle()
            regs["X"] += num

print(ans)
submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

I took so long for Part 2 because of a silly error. I initially defined the screen using `screen = [["."]*40]*6`, but unfortunately all of the lists defined by `*` are just different references to the same list. So when I updated one, it would update them all. Unfortunately, I spent longer catching this than I would have liked. I'm going to make a helper for defining X*Y*... lists for future use.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import data_in

din = data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
cycles = 0

regs = {"X": 1}
screen = []
for i in range(6):
    a = []
    for j in range(40):
        a.append(".")
    screen.append(a)

posx, posy = 0, 0


def cycle():
    global regs, cycles, posx, posy
    if posx == regs["X"]-1 or posx == regs["X"] or posx == regs["X"]+1:
        screen[posy][posx] = "#"
    posx += 1
    cycles += 1
    if posx == 40:
        posx = 0
        posy += 1


for line in din:
    if line.startswith("noop"):
        cycle()
    else:
        instr = line.split(" ")[0]
        num = int(line.split(" ")[1])

        if instr == "addx":
            cycle()
            cycle()
            regs["X"] += num

for thing in screen:
    print("".join(thing))
```

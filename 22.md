# Day 22

This is another day that I didn't stay up until midnight to do the problem when it came out. After I did Part 1, I didn't have any time to do Part 2 until 12/24.

## Part 1

Part 1 was farily simple enough. I used a dictionary to store the positions and a function to loop around if necessary.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import data_in, submit
from helpers.matrix import Matrix
import re
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
import time
import math
from tqdm import tqdm

ans = 0
din = data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

path = ""
grid = defaultdict(int)
bounds = [0, 0]

for i in range(len(din)):
    if not din[i]:
        path = din[i+1]
        break
    for j in range(len(din[i])):
        char = din[i][j]
        if char != " ":
            grid[(i, j)] = char
            bounds = max(bounds[0], i), max(bounds[1], j)

print(grid)
move_set = [int(x) if x.isnumeric() else x for x in re.findall(r'\d+|[RL]', path)]
print(move_set)
print(bounds)

for i in range(bounds[1]):
    if grid[(0, i)] != 0:
        break

# Initial position
at = (0, i)


def go(at, num, dir):
    def get_next(at, dir):
        x, y = at
        dx, dy = dir
        if grid[(x + dx, y + dy)] != 0:
            return tuple([x + dx, y + dy])
        else:
            while grid[(x - dx, y - dy)] != 0:
                x -= dx
                y -= dy
            return tuple([x, y])

    while grid[get_next(at, dir)] != "#" and num > 0:
        at = get_next(at, dir)
        num -= 1
    return at


# Right down left up
dirs = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]]
# Start facing right
facing = 0

for move in move_set:
    if type(move) is int:
        print(at)
        at = go(at, move, dirs[facing])
    elif move == "R":
        facing = (facing + 1) % 4
    elif move == "L":
        facing = (facing - 1) % 4

ans = 1000 * (at[0] + 1) + 4 * (at[1] + 1) + facing

print(ans)
submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

I wanted to make a general solution for Part 2, but unfortunately in the interest of time I decided to make a ghastly if statement so I could get this puzzle over with and move on to other ones I had gotten behind on.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import data_in, submit
from helpers.matrix import Matrix
import re
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
import time
import math
from tqdm import tqdm

ans = 0
din = data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

path = ""
grid = defaultdict(int)
bounds = [0, 0]

for i in range(len(din)):
    if not din[i]:
        path = din[i+1]
        break
    for j in range(len(din[i])):
        char = din[i][j]
        if char != " ":
            grid[(i, j)] = char
            bounds = max(bounds[0], i), max(bounds[1], j)

#print(grid)
move_set = [int(x) if x.isnumeric() else x for x in re.findall(r'\d+|[RL]', path)]

for i in range(bounds[1]):
    if grid[(0, i)] != 0:
        break

# Initial position
at = (0, i)


def go(at, num, dir):
    def get_next(at, facin):
        x, y = at
        dx, dy = dirs[facin]
        if grid[(x + dx, y + dy)] != 0:
            return tuple([x + dx, y + dy]), facin
        # Off 2 facing right
        elif y == 149 and x >= 0 and x < 50 and facin == 0:
            return tuple([49 - x + 100, 99]), (facin + 2) % 4
        # Off 2 facing down
        elif y >= 100 and y < 150 and x == 49 and facin == 1:
            return tuple([y - 50, 99]), (facin + 1) % 4
        # Off 2 facing up
        elif y >= 100 and y < 150 and x == 0 and facin == 3:
            return tuple([199, y - 100]), facin
        # Off 3 facing right
        elif y == 99 and x >= 50 and x < 100 and facin == 0:
            return tuple([49, (x - 50) + 100]), (facin - 1) % 4
        # Off 3 facing left
        elif y == 50 and x >= 50 and x < 100 and facin == 2:
            return tuple([100, x - 50]), (facin - 1) % 4
        # Off 5 facing right
        elif y == 99 and x >= 100 and x < 150 and facin == 0:
            return tuple([49 - (x - 100), 149]), (facin - 2) % 4
        # Off 5 facing down
        elif y >= 50 and y < 100 and x == 149 and facin == 1:
            return tuple([(y - 50) + 150, 49]), (facin + 1) % 4
        # Off 6 facing down
        elif y >= 0 and y < 50 and x == 199 and facin == 1:
            return tuple([0, y + 100]), facin
        # Off 6 facing right
        elif y == 49 and x >= 150 and x < 200 and facin == 0:
            return tuple([149, (x - 150) + 50]), (facin - 1) % 4
        # Off 6 facing left
        elif y == 0 and x >= 150 and x < 200 and facin == 2:
            return tuple([0, (x - 150) + 50]), (facin + 3) % 4
        # Off 4 facing left
        elif y == 0 and x >= 100 and x < 150 and facin == 2:
            return tuple([49 - (x - 100), 50]), (facin + 2) % 4

        elif y >= 0 and y < 50 and x == 100 and facin == 3:
            return tuple([y + 50, 50]), (facin + 1) % 4
        # Off 1 facing left
        elif y == 50 and x >= 0 and x < 50 and facin == 2:

        # Off 1 facing up
        elif y >= 50 and y < 100 and x == 0 and facin == 3:
            return tuple([y + 100, 0]), (facin - 3) % 4
        else:
            exit("It shouldn't get here")

    while grid[get_next(at, dir)[0]] != "#" and num > 0:
        at, dir = get_next(at, dir)

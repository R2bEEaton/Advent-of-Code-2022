# Day 25

It's been a blast! This is my first time ever completing all the puzzles of an Advent of Code year, and it feels great! I grinded on 12/24 before midnight to get all the puzzles I was behind on (due to exams and Christmas activities). Unfortunately, I was not able to complete Day 24 Part 2 in time, so my 50th star was locked out. After completing Day 25 Part 1, I decided to stay up and work on Day 24 Part 2 (which honestly was just waiting for my silly code to finish running 30 minutes later).

I was ***2077th*** to complete Day 25 Part 2 and hence, ***2077th*** to complete all of Advent of Code 2022! (That's ***1=2=02th*** in SNAFU.)

```
It's been a wild ride, and a whole lot of fun;
Talking with elephants, monkeys, and elves.
We learned a lot and improved ourselves.
Goodnight, and Merry Christmas everyone!

## Part 1

```python
from helpers.datagetter import data_in, submit

ans = 0
din = data_in(split=True, numbers=False)


def snafu(n):
    num = 0
    for i in range(len(n)):
        place = len(line) - i - 1
        if line[i].isdigit():
            num += int(line[i]) * 5 ** place
        elif line[i] == "-":
            num -= 5 ** place
        elif line[i] == "=":
            num -= 5 ** place
            num -= 5 ** place
    return num


def unsnafu(n):
    s = ""
    while n:
        m = str(n % 5)
        if m == '3':
            s = "=" + s
            n //= 5
            n += 1
        elif m == '4':
            s = "-" + s
            n //= 5
            n += 1
        else:
            s = m + s
            n //= 5
    return s


for line in din:
    ans += snafu(line)

print(ans)
ans = unsnafu(ans)
print(ans)
submit(ans)

```

Yeah... I threw in the towel around 2:30 AM. Finished Part 2 on 12/19.

## Part 1

I think Part 1 is off by one. Not sure, I had to subtract 1 from the answer it gave me and I honestly forget why (or if I even did).

```python
from helpers.datagetter import data_in, submit
from helpers.matrix import Matrix
import re
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
import time
import math
from tqdm import tqdm

ans = 0
din = data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

paths = {}
for line in din:
    linez = line.split(" ")
    paths[linez[1]] = [int(linez[4].split("=")[1].split(";")[0]), " ".join(linez[9:]).split(", ")]
print(paths)


def get_shortest_path(fro, to):
    queue = [[fro]]
    visited = []

    while queue:
        path = queue.pop(0)
        node = path[-1]
        if node not in visited:
            visited.append(node)
            if node == to:
                return path
            else:
                for thing in paths[node][1]:
                    queue.append(path + [thing])


# Compute distances from each node to each other node
dists = {}
for node1 in paths.keys():
    for node2 in paths.keys():
        if node1 != node2:
            dists[f"{node1}->{node2}"] = len(get_shortest_path(node1, node2))

# Get all valves of concern (where flow rate is > 0)
valves = []
for key, val in paths.items():
    if val[0] != 0:
        valves.append(key)

all_paths = {}


def dfs(curr, path, mins, pressure):
    global all_paths
    for node in valves:
        if node in path:
            continue
        new_time = mins - dists[f"{curr}->{node}"]
        if new_time <= 0:
            continue

        best_flow = pressure + new_time * paths[node][0]
        all_paths["->".join(path + [node])] = best_flow
        dfs(node, path + [node], new_time, best_flow)


dfs('AA', [], 30, 0)
ans = 0
for thing in all_paths:
    ans = max(ans, all_paths[thing])

print(ans)
submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

This code tries all combinations of hitting all the valves. So, for my input with 15 non-zero valves, It tries `(1, 14)`, `(2, 13)`, etc. up to `(7, 8)`. There is no need to check any further because you and the elephant are indistinguishable with regards to the answer.

So, I used the same code as I did in Part 1 except added a maximum number of valves into my recursive DFS and also a list of available valves. For the first person, he has all non-zero valves available, and the second player has all the non-zero valves _minus_ the ones that the first player visited.

In all, this took 1420 seconds (or 23 minutes and 40 seconds), which is long but acceptable for me.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import data_in, submit
import time

ans = 0
din = data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

paths = {}
for line in din:
    linez = line.split(" ")
    paths[linez[1]] = [int(linez[4].split("=")[1].split(";")[0]), " ".join(linez[9:]).split(", ")]
print(paths)


def get_shortest_path(fro, to):
    queue = [[fro]]
    visited = []

    while queue:
        path = queue.pop(0)
        node = path[-1]
        if node not in visited:
            visited.append(node)
            if node == to:
                return path
            else:
                for thing in paths[node][1]:
                    queue.append(path + [thing])


# Compute distances from each node to each other node
dists = {}
for node1 in paths.keys():
    for node2 in paths.keys():
        if node1 != node2:
            dists[f"{node1}->{node2}"] = len(get_shortest_path(node1, node2))

# Get all valves of concern (where flow rate is > 0)
valves = []
for key, val in paths.items():
    if val[0] != 0:
        valves.append(key)


def dfs_helper(a, b):
    print("Trying", a, b)
    global all_paths
    all_paths = {}
    dfs('AA', [], 26, 0, a, valves)
    all_your_paths = all_paths.copy()
    best = 0

    for thing in all_your_paths:
        all_paths = {}
        dfs('AA', [], 26, 0, b, list(set(valves) - set(thing.split("->"))))
        best = max(best, all_your_paths[thing] + max(all_paths.values()))

    return best


def dfs(curr, path, mins, pressure, length, valid):
    global all_paths, ans

    if mins <= 0 or len(path) > length - 1:
        return

    for you in valid:
        if you in path:
            continue
        new_time_you = mins - dists[f"{curr}->{you}"]
        best_flow = pressure + new_time_you * paths[you][0]

        if new_time_you > 0:
            all_paths["->".join(path + [you])] = best_flow
            dfs(you, path + [you], new_time_you, best_flow, length, valid)


start = time.time()
ans = 0
for i in range(len(valves)):
    for j in range(i, len(valves)):
        if i + j == len(valves):
            ans = max(ans, dfs_helper(i, j))
            print(time.time() - start)

print(time.time() - start)
print(ans)
submit(ans)
```

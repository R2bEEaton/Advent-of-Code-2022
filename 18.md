Yay!!! I can go to bed now!

## Part 1

This one was a simple "just do it" type of problem. Nice change of pace from the past few days...

```python
from helpers.datagetter import data_in, submit
from collections import defaultdict

ans = 0
din = data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

cubes = defaultdict(int)

for line in din:
    cubes[tuple(line)] = 1


def exposed_faces(pos):
    x = pos[0]
    y = pos[1]
    z = pos[2]

    exposed = 0
    if (x + 1, y, z) not in cubes:
        exposed += 1
    if (x - 1, y, z) not in cubes:
        exposed += 1
    if (x, y + 1, z) not in cubes:
        exposed += 1
    if (x, y - 1, z) not in cubes:
        exposed += 1
    if (x, y, z + 1) not in cubes:
        exposed += 1
    if (x, y, z - 1) not in cubes:
        exposed += 1

    return exposed


print(cubes)
for cube in cubes.keys():
    ans += exposed_faces(cube)

print(ans)
submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

For Part 2 I decided to implement a flood-fill of the outside of the obsidian structure and invert it to do the surface area counting again. I had some trouble with the flood fill logic and some maximum recursion errors, which was silly of me, but got there in the end. Just happy to be going to bed at a reasonable time! The flood-filler is poorly made so it takes a few seconds to run on my machine which should not be the case for such a simple problem. Whatever!

Also yes, the code is ugly. Keep in mind this is _after_ a slight refactoring and getting rid of unused bits.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import data_in, submit
from collections import defaultdict

ans = 0
din = data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

cubes = defaultdict(int)

for line in din:
    cubes[tuple(line)] = 1


def exposed_faces(pos):
    global check
    x = pos[0]
    y = pos[1]
    z = pos[2]

    exposed = 0
    if (x + 1, y, z) not in cubes:
        exposed += 1
    if (x - 1, y, z) not in cubes:
        exposed += 1
    if (x, y + 1, z) not in cubes:
        exposed += 1
    if (x, y - 1, z) not in cubes:
        exposed += 1
    if (x, y, z + 1) not in cubes:
        exposed += 1
    if (x, y, z - 1) not in cubes:
        exposed += 1

    return exposed


minx, miny, minz = 100, 100, 100
maxx, maxy, maxz = 0, 0, 0

for cube in cubes.keys():
    minx = min(minx, cube[0])
    miny = min(miny, cube[1])
    minz = min(minz, cube[2])
    maxx = max(maxx, cube[0])
    maxy = max(maxy, cube[1])
    maxz = max(maxz, cube[2])
    ans += exposed_faces(cube)

new_stuff = defaultdict(int)
visited = []


def flood_fill(start):
    queue = [start]
    while queue:
        x, y, z = queue.pop(0)
        if x < minx - 1 or y < miny - 1 or z < minz - 1 or x > maxx + 1 or y > maxy + 1 or z > maxz + 1:
            continue

        if cubes[(x, y, z)] == 0:
            new_stuff[(x, y, z)] = 1

            if (x + 1, y, z) not in queue and (x + 1, y, z) not in visited:
                queue.append((x + 1, y, z))
                visited.append((x + 1, y, z))
            if (x - 1, y, z) not in queue and (x - 1, y, z) not in visited:
                queue.append((x - 1, y, z))
                visited.append((x - 1, y, z))
            if (x, y + 1, z) not in queue and (x, y + 1, z) not in visited:
                queue.append((x, y + 1, z))
                visited.append((x, y + 1, z))
            if (x, y - 1, z) not in queue and (x, y - 1, z) not in visited:

                visited.append((x, y, z + 1))
            if (x, y, z - 1) not in queue and (x, y, z - 1) not in visited:
                queue.append((x, y, z - 1))
                visited.append((x, y, z - 1))


flood_fill((minx - 1, miny - 1, minz - 1))
cubes = defaultdict(int)

for i in range(minx, maxx + 1):
    for j in range(miny, maxy + 1):
        for k in range(minz, maxz + 1):
            if new_stuff[(i, j, k)] == 0:
                cubes[(i, j, k)] = 1

ans = 0
for cube in cubes.keys():
    ans += exposed_faces(cube)

print(ans)
submit(ans)
